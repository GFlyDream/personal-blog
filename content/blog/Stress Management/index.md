## Why do we feel stressed?

Stress is a natural reaction to a stressful event, like a death in the family or a job interview. It&#39;s our body&#39;s way of preparing us to react to difficult events. But when these feelings become chronic, it can be hard to handle.

Stress takes a toll on our bodies, whether it be through illness, lack of productivity, or social isolation. It can be hard to manage your stress at times, but there are ways to do so. One important thing to remember is that we all react differently to stress. What might help one person may not work for someone else—some people might like deep breathing exercises while others might like meditating.

## Know your triggers

We all have different triggers that stress us out. It could be a time of day, a certain event, or a person. Knowing what your triggers are and why you get stressed can help you avoid future instances.

For example, if you&#39;re stressed about the idea of speaking in public and you understand why, you can try to tackle that fear by speaking up in front of a group before the event. Or if you&#39;re concerned about how others see you, you should try to spend more time with people who make you feel comfortable and loved.

The key is discovering what causes your stress and taking steps to avoid it. Stress management techniques should be an integral part of your day-to-day life!

## Take a time out from the stressful situation

When you&#39;re feeling stressed, it can be helpful to take a break from the stressful situation. This is one of the most important ways you can manage your stress levels. When we feel tension and stress, our mind and body go into fight or flight mode. If you&#39;ve ever had a panic attack, you know what this feels like—your breathing speeds up and your heart is beating out of your chest.

By removing yourself from the stressful situation, you allow your body and mind to return to normal and return to equilibrium. It is important that you don&#39;t stay away from the stressful situation for too long, as it will only heighten your stress levels and make it more difficult to manage.

You can take a timeout for as long as you need to. This could be five minutes or it could be an hour. Everyone is different. But no matter how long, the break will help you improve your ability to manage your stress levels.

## Conclusion

As you can see, stress is omnipresent in everyone&#39;s life and there is no way to get rid of it. That means that the critical thing is not to avoid stress- but rather learn how to coexist happily with it. I am not a professional therapist nor a certified expert, and if you are having self-hurt thoughts, please contact your local mental health hotline. Regardless, I hope this article will help you navigate better on your quest for a healthy life! All the best!
